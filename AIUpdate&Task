Summary

The repository has multiple AI‑driven features but none of them verify color identity or land counts after receiving AI output.
useAutoDeckBuilder.js builds a deck from GPT‑4o and directly adds cards, only trimming or padding with basic lands. It never checks if those cards match the commander’s colors.
CommanderAiPage.jsx still calls GPT‑3.5 for suggestions (see model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo').
getSuggestions defaults to the model 'o4-mini'.
SuggestedCard.jsx adds a card to the deck with addCard(card); without validating anything.

Recommended Improvements
Enforce color identity on AI‑built decks

After parsing the AI deck list in useAutoDeckBuilder.js, run validateColorIdentity(commander, parsedCards) from deckValidator.js and drop or replace any violating cards.

Optionally use validateDeck to check singleton and legality before addCardsFromList.

Upgrade commander recommendations

Change the API call in CommanderAiPage.jsx to model: 'gpt-4o'.

After fetching each suggested commander from Scryfall, compare the AI’s color identity with card.color_identity. Remove or fix any that don’t match.

Improve card suggestion tool

In openaiAPI.js, set model default to 'gpt-4o' so useAISuggestions always uses GPT‑4o.

When a user adds a suggestion, modify SuggestedCard.jsx to run the same color identity and legality checks used in DeckBuilder.jsx before calling addCard.

Reuse validation helpers

Extract the color identity and legality checks in DeckBuilder.jsx to a shared utility so both manual and AI paths enforce the same rules.

These changes will keep AI output compliant with commander colors, reduce invalid suggestions, and ensure consistent deck validation across the app.

Breakdown of Task:

Enforce color identity for AI deck builder
1. Edit `src/hooks/useAutoDeckBuilder.js`.
2. After parsing `cardList` and adjusting counts (around lines 145‑198), call `validateColorIdentity(commander, cardList)` from `deckValidator.js`.
3. Filter out or replace any violations before calling `addCardsFromList`.
4. Optionally run `validateDeck(commander, ...)` for a full check and warn the user if issues remain.

Upgrade commander suggestions to GPT‑4o and verify colors
1. In `src/pages/CommanderAiPage.jsx`, change `model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo'` to `model: 'gpt-4o'`.
2. After fetching each commander’s Scryfall data (around lines 150‑167), compare `aiSuggestion.colors` with `scryfallData.color_identity`.
3. Skip or correct suggestions whose colors don’t match before pushing them to `suggestionsWithFullData`.

Use GPT‑4o and validate suggestions before adding
1. Set the default model in `src/utils/openaiAPI.js` to `'gpt-4o'` (replace `'o4-mini'` at line 24).
2. Create a shared validation helper (e.g., `validateCardForCommander(card, commander)` in `deckValidator.js`).
3. In `src/components/suggestions/SuggestedCard.jsx`, call this helper inside `handleAddCard` and only invoke `addCard` if the card passes.
