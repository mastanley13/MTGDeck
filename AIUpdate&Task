Summary

The repository has multiple AI‑driven features but none of them verify color identity or land counts after receiving AI output.
useAutoDeckBuilder.js builds a deck from GPT‑4o and directly adds cards, only trimming or padding with basic lands. It never checks if those cards match the commander’s colors.
CommanderAiPage.jsx still calls GPT‑3.5 for suggestions (see model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo').
getSuggestions defaults to the model 'o4-mini'.
SuggestedCard.jsx adds a card to the deck with addCard(card); without validating anything.

Auto Deck Builder
The deck builder prompt tells GPT‑4o to keep decks within the commander’s colors and at exactly 99 cards. After receiving the list, the code only adjusts counts with trimCardList or addBasicLands, then blindly adds cards to the deck. There is no validation that each card’s colors match the commander. You already have a full validator in deckValidator.js (see validateDeck) that checks color identity, singleton rules, and card count.

Improvement: After building the deck, run validateColorIdentity (or validateDeck) on the AI list before adding cards. If violations exist, filter or replace those cards. This ensures no off‑color picks or excess lands get added.

Commander Suggestions
CommanderAiPage.jsx uses the older gpt‑3.5‑turbo model and accepts whatever JSON it returns. No color‑identity check is done on the suggestions before displaying them.

Improvement: Upgrade the model to GPT‑4o and verify each commander’s color identity via Scryfall before showing it to the user. That will catch any mismatch between suggested colors and the commander card.

Card Suggestion Tool
getSuggestions defaults to model 'o4-mini' and asks for suggestions respecting color identity. The parsed suggestions are returned without validation. When the user clicks “Add to Deck,” the card is added directly from Scryfall by SuggestedCard without checking its color identity or legality.

Improvement:

Use the same validation (isColorIdentityCompliant from the deck builder or validateColorIdentity) before allowing a suggested card to be added.

Consider using gpt‑4o or the standard GPT‑4 model instead of 'o4-mini' for better accuracy in the suggestions.

Manual Deck Building
When a user manually adds a card, DeckBuilder.jsx already enforces color identity and format legality checks before calling addCard. This is the right approach—extend similar checks to AI‑generated lists and suggestions so all paths enforce the same rules.


Recommended Improvements
Enforce color identity on AI‑built decks

After parsing the AI deck list in useAutoDeckBuilder.js, run validateColorIdentity(commander, parsedCards) from deckValidator.js and drop or replace any violating cards.

Optionally use validateDeck to check singleton and legality before addCardsFromList.

Upgrade commander recommendations

Change the API call in CommanderAiPage.jsx to model: 'gpt-4o'.

After fetching each suggested commander from Scryfall, compare the AI’s color identity with card.color_identity. Remove or fix any that don’t match.

Improve card suggestion tool

In openaiAPI.js, set model default to 'gpt-4o' so useAISuggestions always uses GPT‑4o.

When a user adds a suggestion, modify SuggestedCard.jsx to run the same color identity and legality checks used in DeckBuilder.jsx before calling addCard.

Reuse validation helpers

Extract the color identity and legality checks in DeckBuilder.jsx to a shared utility so both manual and AI paths enforce the same rules.

These changes will keep AI output compliant with commander colors, reduce invalid suggestions, and ensure consistent deck validation across the app.

Breakdown of Task:

Enforce color identity for AI deck builder
1. Edit `src/hooks/useAutoDeckBuilder.js`.
2. After parsing `cardList` and adjusting counts (around lines 145‑198), call `validateColorIdentity(commander, cardList)` from `deckValidator.js`.
3. Filter out or replace any violations before calling `addCardsFromList`.
4. Optionally run `validateDeck(commander, ...)` for a full check and warn the user if issues remain.

Upgrade commander suggestions to GPT‑4o and verify colors
1. In `src/pages/CommanderAiPage.jsx`, change `model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo'` to `model: 'gpt-4o'`.
2. After fetching each commander’s Scryfall data (around lines 150‑167), compare `aiSuggestion.colors` with `scryfallData.color_identity`.
3. Skip or correct suggestions whose colors don’t match before pushing them to `suggestionsWithFullData`.

Use GPT‑4o and validate suggestions before adding
1. Set the default model in `src/utils/openaiAPI.js` to `'gpt-4o'` (replace `'o4-mini'` at line 24).
2. Create a shared validation helper (e.g., `validateCardForCommander(card, commander)` in `deckValidator.js`).
3. In `src/components/suggestions/SuggestedCard.jsx`, call this helper inside `handleAddCard` and only invoke `addCard` if the card passes.
