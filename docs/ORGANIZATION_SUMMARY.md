# Documentation Organization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the reorganization of markdown documentation files for the MTG App project.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Organized Directory Structure
```
docs/
├── README.md (overview and navigation guide)
├── development/ (3 files)
├── implementation/ (4 files)
├── guides/ (2 files)
├── analysis/ (4 files)
├── setup/ (2 files)
├── features/ (3 files)
└── automation/ (2 files)
```

### 2. Files Moved and Organized

**From Root Directory to Organized Structure:**
- 18 markdown files were moved from the project root
- 3 existing files in docs/ were reorganized into subfolders
- Total: 21 documentation files organized

### 3. Categorization Logic

**Development** - Strategic plans and implementation roadmaps
**Implementation** - Technical completion summaries and implementation details
**Guides** - User-facing documentation and API guides
**Analysis** - Performance analysis, testing results, and investigations
**Setup** - Configuration and installation guides
**Features** - Feature specifications, proposals, and bug fixes
**Automation** - Automated processes and workflow documentation

### 4. Benefits of New Organization

- **Improved Discoverability**: Related documents are grouped together
- **Logical Navigation**: Clear categories make finding information easier
- **Scalability**: Structure can grow as project documentation expands
- **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain and update related documents
- **Onboarding**: New team members can quickly find relevant documentation

### 5. Files Preserved in Root
- `README.md` - Main project README (kept in root as expected)

## Next Steps

1. **Update Internal Links**: Review documents for internal references that may need updating
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Consider updating any build processes that reference old paths
3. **Team Communication**: Inform team members of the new documentation structure
4. **Bookmark Updates**: Update any bookmarks or references to old file locations
