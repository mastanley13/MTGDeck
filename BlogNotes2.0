To generate high-quality **Magic: The Gathering (MTG)** blogs and post them directly via **GoHighLevel's Blog API**, follow this efficient, automated pipeline:

---

### üîÅ SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**Goal**: Automate MTG blog generation and publishing using AI + GoHighLevel.

**Key Stack**:

* **OpenAI API (GPT-4/o)** ‚Äî for writing the content.
* **GoHighLevel Private API (Blog endpoint)** ‚Äî to publish blog posts.
* **Optional: Make.com or Zapier** ‚Äî to connect both if you don't want to hardcode.

---

### ‚úÖ STEP-BY-STEP SYSTEM

#### 1. **Define Blog Content Framework**

To keep quality consistent, define structure:

* **Title** (with SEO keywords)
* **Intro** (hook + what the post will cover)
* **Main Sections** (choose 2‚Äì4 of these):

  * Deck strategy
  * Card analysis
  * Meta shifts
  * Commander combos
  * Budget vs competitive builds
* **Final Thoughts** (summary + call to comment/share)
* **Tags** (used for GHL blog filtering)

‚úÖ Store this as a **template prompt** for OpenAI.

---

#### 2. **Write Reusable Prompt for GPT**

Here‚Äôs a working prompt template:

```text
Write a 1000-word blog post about Magic: The Gathering. The topic is "{{TOPIC}}". Use an SEO-friendly title and intro. The post should include strategic insights, analysis, and friendly tone for Commander players. Format in HTML (h1 for title, h2 for sections, p for text). End with a CTA to visit the rest of the blog. Include a meta description and tags.
```

Examples of topics:

* ‚ÄúBest Budget Commanders in 2025‚Äù
* ‚ÄúHow to Build Around Atraxa: Deck Guide‚Äù
* ‚ÄúIs EDH Still Casual? A Meta Overview‚Äù

---

#### 3. **Automate with OpenAI + Blog API**

##### Option A: **Custom Script**

If coding, set this up in Python or Node.js:

1. Call GPT-4 API with your prompt.
2. Parse the response to get `title`, `meta description`, `content`, `tags`.
3. POST to GHL‚Äôs `/blogs/` endpoint:

```http
POST https://rest.gohighlevel.com/v1/blogs/
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer {{PRIVATE_API_KEY}}
  Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
  "title": "Your Blog Title",
  "content": "<h1>...</h1><p>...</p>",
  "description": "Meta description",
  "tags": ["commander", "strategy", "mtg"],
  "categoryId": "optional-category-id"
}
```

##### Option B: **Make.com (No-Code)**

1. Trigger (manually or on schedule).
2. Use OpenAI module to generate the blog.
3. Format blog in Make using HTML tools.
4. Use **HTTP module** to POST to GoHighLevel `/blogs`.

---

#### 4. **Enhance with SEO**

In your prompt or post-processing, add:

* Meta description (155 characters)
* Alt tags for images (if used)
* Keyword usage (commander, EDH, MTG strategy, etc.)

---

### üîÑ RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW

* **Batch Generate 5 Posts Weekly** from a topic list.
* **Review/edit (optional)** before pushing to GHL.
* Use **GHL scheduling** if you want them staggered.
